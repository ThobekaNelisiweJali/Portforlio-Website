# Porfolio Website Hackathon 2025 


# Brief Introduction

Hi, Iâ€™m Thobeka Jali, an aspiring data scientist with a keen interest in using data to solve real-world problemsâ€”especially within supply chain and operations. Iâ€™m passionate about turning raw data into meaningful insights through analytics, machine learning, and optimization techniques. As I continue to grow in this field, Iâ€™m focused on building strong foundations, developing hands-on projects, and constantly learning new tools and technologies. This portfolio website is a reflection of my journey so far and the work Iâ€™m excited to share. Stay tuned and I hope you love it.


# Project Content

The project that I have presented is a portfolio website that consists of the following sections 

ðŸ§­ Navigation and Home Section

The navigation bar provides easy access to every part of the site, ensuring a smooth user experience. The home section offers a welcoming introduction, setting the tone for the rest of the portfolio. It briefly states who I am and what I do, giving visitors a quick overview of my professional identity as an aspiring data scientist.

ðŸ‘¤ About Me Section
This section dives deeper into who I am beyond just my title. I share my motivation for entering the world of data science, my personal values, and how I approach problem-solving. It also highlights my passion for continuous learning and my desire to apply data to create meaningful impactâ€”especially in areas like business analytics and supply chain optimization.

ðŸŽ“ Education Background Section
Here, I outline my academic history, including degrees obtained, institutions attended, and relevant coursework. I also touch on certifications and online programs Iâ€™ve completed to expand my skill set. This section helps paint a clear picture of the foundational knowledge that supports my data science journey.

ðŸ’¡ Areas of Interest Section
In this section, I showcase the specific areas within data science that excite me the most. These include machine learning, data visualization, time series forecasting, optimization models, and big data analytics. I also highlight how I aim to apply these skills in real-world industries, particularly in solving operational and supply chain challenges.

ðŸ§ª Projects Section
This is a hands-on display of what I can do. I feature projects Iâ€™ve worked onâ€”ranging from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and optimization. Each project includes a brief summary, tools and techniques used, and the outcomes achieved. This section demonstrates not just my technical abilities but also how I apply them to solve practical problems.

ðŸ“¬ Contact Me Section
The final section invites visitors to connect. Whether it's for collaboration, mentorship, or job opportunities, I make it easy for people to reach out through an embedded form. Iâ€™ve also included social media and GitHub links for anyone who wants to explore more of my work or follow my journey.

# Reading The Code 

The code to both my html file and CSS File has been provided in the following manner. 

- An HTML and CSS folder that consists of the entire code for the project. This was attached for those who prefer to see the whole document in one page
- Sectional HTML folders that consist of the code for each section on the html file. Just go to the desired section and you will find the code for that section. All html files have the .html attribute
- Sectional CSS files that consist of the code for sections in the CSS files. I tried my best to make it easier for reading. If its a bit confusing please refer to the complete folder. 

  
# Challenges and Lessons 

Ininitally I had used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to complete my project. Little did I know that I would have to delete the entire javascript file that made up almost half of my project. Not only did I experience a mini mental break down I consulted with chatgpt seeking for guidance on the way forward. ChatGPT suggested HTML and CSS annimations that I was willing to try. It took me a whole day to figure out just the design which was frustrating yet fulfilling in the end. I also never knew how something as simple as selecting the right colors could be so frustrating. I spent almost two hours just googling and trying out different shades of blue to ensure they dont clash with the overall theme. I cant fail to mention the accidental deletion of sections which caused me a mini panicc but luckily I was able to find my way back.
